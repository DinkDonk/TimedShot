Timed Shot
==========

Timed Shot is an iOS app that interacts with Siri to make timed video.

### Usage

1. Launch the app and accept the privacy settings.
2. After the app closes, open the `Shortcuts` app.
3. Enter Gallery and find the `Shoot for 15 seconds` in `Shortcuts from Your Apps`.
4. Add the shortcut, modify it or add some more with different durations.
5. Say `Hey Siri, shoot for 15 seconds` – The TimedShot app should open and a timer counting from 15 should appear.
